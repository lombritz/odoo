// this file contains the screens definitions. Screens are the
// content of the right pane of the pos, containing the main functionalities. 
// screens are contained in the PosWidget, in pos_widget.js
// all screens are present in the dom at all time, but only one is shown at the
// same time. 
//
// transition between screens is made possible by the use of the screen_selector,
// which is responsible of hiding and showing the screens, as well as maintaining
// the state of the screens between different orders.
//
// all screens inherit from ScreenWidget. the only addition from the base widgets
// are show() and hide() which shows and hides the screen but are also used to 
// bind and unbind actions on widgets and devices. The screen_selector guarantees
// that only one screen is shown at the same time and that show() is called after all
// hide()s

            // The problem is that in chrome the print() is asynchronous and doesn't
            // execute until all rpc are finished. So it conflicts with the rpc used
            // to send the orders to the backend, and the user is able to go to the next 
            // screen before the printing dialog is opened. The problem is that what's 
            // printed is whatever is in the page when the dialog is opened and not when it's called,
            // and so you end up printing the product list instead of the receipt... 
            //
            // Fixing this would need a re-architecturing
            // of the code to postpone sending of orders after printing.
            //
            // But since the print dialog also blocks the other asynchronous calls, the
            // button enabling in the setTimeout() is blocked until the printing dialog is 
            // closed. But the timeout has to be big enough or else it doesn't work
            // 2 seconds is the same as the default timeout for sending orders and so the dialog
            // should have appeared before the timeout... so yeah that's not ultra reliable.
